In roulette, bets can be either inside or outside.[12]

# Inside bets
Name	Description	Chip placement
Straight/Single	Bet on a single number	Entirely within the square for the chosen number
Split	Bet on two vertically/horizontally adjacent numbers (e.g. 14-17 or 8–9)	On the edge shared by the numbers
Street	Bet on three consecutive numbers in a horizontal line (e.g. 7-8-9)	On the outer edge of the number at either end of the line
Corner/Square	Bet on four numbers that meet at one corner (e.g. 10-11-13-14)	On the common corner
Six Line/Double Street	Bet on six consecutive numbers that form two horizontal lines (e.g. 31-32-33-34-35-36)	On the outer corner shared by the two leftmost or the two rightmost numbers
Trio/Basket	A three-number bet that involves at least one zero: 0-1-2 (either layout); 0-2-3 (single-zero only); 0-00-2 and 00-2-3 (double-zero only)	On the corner shared by the three chosen numbers
First Four	Bet on 0-1-2-3 (Single-zero layout only)	On the outer corner shared by 0-1 or 0-3
Top Line	Bet on 0-00-1-2-3 (Double-zero layout only)	On the outer corner shared by 0-1 or 00-3


# Outside bets
Outside bets typically have smaller payouts with better odds at winning. Except as noted, all of these bets lose if a zero comes up.

1 to 18 (Low or Manque), or 19 to 36 (High or Passe)
A bet that the number will be in the chosen range.
Red or black (Rouge ou Noir)
A bet that the number will be the chosen color.
Even or odd (Pair ou Impair)
A bet that the number will be of the chosen type.
Dozen bet
A bet that the number will be in the chosen dozen: first (1-12, Première douzaine or P12), second (13-24, Moyenne douzaine or M12), or third (25-36, Dernière douzaine or D12).
Column bet
A bet that the number will be in the chosen vertical column of 12 numbers, such as 1-4-7-10 on down to 34. The chip is placed on the space below the final number in this sequence.
Snake Bet
A special bet that covers the numbers 1, 5, 9, 12, 14, 16, 19, 23, 27, 30, 32, and 34. It has the same payout as the dozen bet and takes its name from the zigzagging, snakelike pattern traced out by these numbers. The snake bet is not available in all casinos; when it is allowed, the chip is placed on the lower corner of the 34 square that borders the 19-36 betting box. Some layouts mark the bet with a two-headed snake that winds from 1 to 34, and the bet can be placed on the head at either end of the body.
In the United Kingdom, the farthest outside bets (low/high, red/black, even/odd) result in the player losing only half of their bet if a zero comes up.
